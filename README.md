## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites:**  
  Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

   - Node.js
   - npm or yarn
   - Expo CLI (for development)

- **Installation Steps:**

   1. Clone the repository

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/AlexanderTsankov/taskmaster.git
      cd todo-app
      ```

   2. Install project dependencies:

      ```

   3. Start the development server:

      In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:
